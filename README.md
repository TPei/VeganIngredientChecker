# Vegan Ingredient Bot
## What does it do?
A Telegram bot that can tell you if an ingredient is vegan or not

## How do I use it?
Start a chat with [the bot](http://telegram.me/VeganIngredientBot) and
ask it about an ingredient!

![the bot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TPei/VeganIngredientCheckerBot/master/bot_demo.jpg)

Commands
- /start - simple instructions
- /help - help about commands
- /check ingredient_name - checks veganpeace.com if an ingredient is
  vegan or not (/check is only necessary in group chats)

## Known issues
- spelling (spaces, dashes etc) needs to match veganpeace.com
- incomplete names that are part of multiple ingredients (methyl alcohol
  / cellulose match the first entry)

## Planned features
- better handling (guessing) of ingredients by using the closest match
