# Vegan Ingredient Bot
## What does it do?
A Telegram bot that can tell you if an ingredient is vegan or not

## How do I use it?
Start a chat with [the bot](http://telegram.me/VeganIngredientBot) and
ask it about an ingredient!

Commands
- /start - simple instructions
- /help - help about commands
- /check ingredient_name - checks veganpeace.com if an ingredient is
  vegan or not (/check is only necessary in group chats)

## Known issues
- spelling (spaces, dashes etc) needs to match veganpeace.com
- could potentially match the wrong ingredient (if it is mentioned
  somewhere else) without the user noticing

## Planned features
- better handling (guessing) of ingredients by using the closest match
